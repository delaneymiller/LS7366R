# LS7366R
A simple python library to interface the Raspberry Pi with the LS7366R IC.

To run the simple test application run the LS7366R.py script.
You should be able to interface with this script and write your own interface for it.
Using this library I was able to comfortably reach a sampling rate of at least 125Hz.
If speed in the KHz is needed, you will have to use C++.


Make sure the Pi has spidev installed, and that SPI is enabled.
